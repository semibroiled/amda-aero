% Anmerkungen: Should topspeed and v_max be combined or dispayed separately 
% as is? Functions based on varying P and A, since I didn't know their values. 
% Was the demand to form function on known P and A? If yes, the function need 
% to be modified to include them as constants as opposed to variables.
